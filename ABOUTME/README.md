# About Me

I am currently a tenured associate professor in the Computer
Science Department at Boston University (BU).
  
Before Joining BU in October 2001, I was a tenure-track assistant
professor at the Electrical & Computer Engineering and Computer
Science at University of Cincinnati (UC).

Before joining UC in September 1999, I was a post-doctoral
researcher at [PacSoft](http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/.)
(Pacific Software Research Centre) working on
[Formal Methods](http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/FM/.)
And my supervisor was Prof. [Jim Hook](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~hook).
I joined PacSoft in August 1998 after finishing my PhD thesis
[Dependent Types in Practical Programming](./../ACADEMIC/papers/thesis.ps)
under the supervision of Prof. [Frank Pfenning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp)
from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu).

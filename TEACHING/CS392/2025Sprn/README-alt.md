## Spring, 2025

I am scheduled to teach BU CAS CS392 in Spring, 2025.

### Title

* Modern Compiler Construction in Python

### Overview

Modern Compiler Construction in Python is a course that introduces
students to some basics in the design and implementation of
compilers. In this course, we teach the theory behind various
components of a compiler as well as the programming techniques
involved to put the theory into practice. In particular, we adopt a
style of modern compiler construction that builds a compiler by
stringing a sequence of translations sharing a common closure-based
interpreter-like structures.  The chosen programming language for
implementation is Python 3. However, you can seek the instructorâ€™s
approval to choose a functional programming language as your
implementation language if you so wish.

### Grading Policy

First and foremost, if you are not sure about what is being asked to
do, please seek clarification on the Piazza page.

If you feel that your work is not fairly graded, please raise your
concern to me ASAP. If you don't, then I could not tell.

1. For a programming task, your implementation must compile and pass a
given test in order for you to receive *any* credit.

### Prerequisites

Familiarity with programming in general:

* CS111 & CS320 (or something equivalent)

### Textbooks

## Spring, 2025

I am scheduled to teach BU CAS CS392X1 in Spring, 2025.

### Title

* Introduction to CS II -- Data Structures

### Overview

This course starts by quickly revisiting and then building upon basic
programming concepts in Java. Then, the main focus of the course is on
the design, analysis and implementation of fundamental data structures
used throughout computer science. These include linked lists, stacks,
queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, as well as specialized methods for
searching and sorting. All of our implementations will be done in the the
object-oriented programming language Java. The emphasis in teaching
this course centers around the following:

* Developing elegant and efficient code from an abstract specification;
* Literate programming (writing programs that can be read by humans as well
as machines);
* Developing a toolbox of advanced data structures for use in your future
programming tasks, and an awareness of various design patterns that recur
frequently in advanced programming;
* Critical thinking about programs and the programming process, which
involves:
  * Thinking about the best way to plan out the design using object-oriented
design and appropriate features of Java;
  * Methodical and efficient development of the implementation using step-wise
refinement and incremental testing and debugging (using appropriate
debugging tools);
  * Being able to convince yourself of the correctness of the implementation by
mathematical reasoning;
  * Analyzing the running time (efficiency) of programs by inspection and
mathematical reasoning; and
  * Evaluating the efficiency and correctness of programs empirically, by using
various tools in properly designed experiments.

### Logistics

* Classroom: CDS 801
* ClassTime: Tue&Thu: 5:00 -- 6:15pm
* Office Hours: To be announced
* Piazza Link: [For discussions](https://piazza.com/bu/spring2025/bucascs392x1/home)
* Class Repository: [https://github.com/hwxi/CS520-2021-Spring](https://github.com/hwxi/CS392-2025-Spring)

### Grading Policy

First and foremost, if you are not sure about what is being asked
to do, please seek clarification on the Piazza page.

If you feel that your work is not fairly graded, please raise your
concern to me ASAP. If you don't, then I could not tell.

### Prerequisites

This course is designed for students who already have a basic level of
proficiency in Java. If you do not have significant previous exposure
to programming, then you are requested to transfer to CS 111.  You are
expected to be familiar with a text editor (e.g., VIM and EMACS).

Hi, there,

This semester, the CS department plans to offer a version of CS112
that moves at a faster pace so that more course content can be
covered.  Also, the version can afford more focus on teaching
programming skills (besides data structures) in Java as well as in
general. For more information, please visit the following link:

If you are interested, please REPLY to this message directly. In your
reply, please describe BRIEFLY your past programming experience.

1. Please state your experience with Java if you have any
2. Please state your experinece with Python if you have any

There will be a short placement test given to you based on your reply.

You may want to take it if
1. you enjoy programming in general, and/or
2. you welcome more programming challenges, and/or
3. you are already familiar with basic programming
   3.1. you are familiar with Java, and/or
   3.2. you are familiar with another language like Python, and/or
   3.3. you are confidant in your ability to pick up Java on your own.

The class for this faster-paced version is small. At most one TA
is expected.
1. As it is being taught for the first time, it will be more subject
   to change. In short, it is somewhat "experimental".
2. Grading tends to be interactive in the sense that you may be given
   chances to fix your programming errors.

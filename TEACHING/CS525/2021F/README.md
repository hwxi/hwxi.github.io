## Fall, 2021

I was scheduled to teach BU CAS CS525 in Fall, 2021.

### Title

* Compiler Design and Implementation

### Overview

Compiler Design and Implementation is a course that introduces
students to some basics in the design and implementation of
compilers. In this course, we are to teach the theory behind various
components of a compiler as well as the programming techniques
involved to put the theory into practice. The chosen programming
language for implementation is ATS. However, you are free to choose
another programming language (preferably, one of functional style) if
you so wish.

### Grading Policy

First and foremost, if you are not sure about what is being asked
to do, please seek clarification on the Piazza page.

If you feel that your work is not fairly graded, please raise your
concern to me ASAP. If you don't, then I could not tell.

### Prerequisites

Familiarity with programming in general:

* CS320 (Concepts of Programming Languages) or Equivalents

### Reference Books
  
1. Modern Compiler Design and Implementation by Andrew Appel.
2. [Introduction to Programming in ATS](http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/HTMLTOC/book1.html) by Hongwei Xi.
3. [A Crash into Functional Programming via ATS](http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/ATS2FUNCRASH/HTML/HTMLTOC/book1.html) by Hongwei Xi.

### Programming Languages

* [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org) (this
  [mode](http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/ATS-Postiats/utils/emacs/ats2-mode.el)
  may be helpful if you use emacs to edit ATS source code)

* Or any other programming languages you are comfortable with.

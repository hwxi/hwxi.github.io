## Fall, 2021

I was scheduled to teach BU CAS CS525 in Fall, 2021.

### Title

* Compiler Design and Implementation

### Overview

This is a course that introduces students to some fundamental
principles and techniques in modern programming language design and
implementation. It focuses on using types to specify and then verify a
variety of program invariants while emphasizing the need for
mathematical formalism in both describing and analyzing programming
languages and programs. Programming for this course is to be done in
a research language (ATS) and the amount of programming is light overall.

### Grading Policy

First and foremost, if you are not sure about what is being asked
to do, please seek clarification on the Piazza page.

If you feel that your work is not fairly graded, please raise your
concern to me ASAP. If you don't, then I could not tell.

1. You receive 10% bonus points for submitting each assignment on time.

2. For a programming task, your implementation must compile and pass a
given test in order for you to receive *any* credit.

3. You can fix bugs in your code and submit for re-grading. There is
an automatic 20% deduction of credit for each re-grading.  For
instance, if you earned 100 points on a re-grading, you would actually
be credited with 80 points.  A request needs to be explicitly made if
you want something to be re-graded for the 2nd time.

### Prerequisites

Familiarity with programming in general:

* CS320 (Concepts of Programming Languages) or Equivalents

### Reference Books
  
1. [Modern Compiler Design and Implementation] by Andrew Appel.
2. [Introduction to Programming in ATS](http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/HTMLTOC/book1.html) by Hongwei Xi.
3. [A Crash into Functional Programming via ATS](http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/ATS2FUNCRASH/HTML/HTMLTOC/book1.html) by Hongwei Xi.

### Programming Languages

* [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org) (this
  [mode](http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/ATS-Postiats/utils/emacs/ats2-mode.el)
  may be helpful if you use emacs to edit ATS source code)

* Or any other programming languages you are comfortable with.

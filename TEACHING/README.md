# Teaching

I primarily teach the following courses at BUCS:

* Compiler Design and Implementation (CS525)
* Principles of Programming Languages (CS520)
* Concepts of Programming Languages (CS320)

## Spring, 2021

I am scheduled to teach BU CAS CS520 in Spring, 2021.

### Title

* Principles of Programming Languages

### Overview

This is a course that introduces students to some fundamental
principles and techniques in modern programming language design and
implementation. It focuses on using types to specify and then verify a
variety of program invariants while emphasizing the need for
mathematical formalism in both describing and analyzing programming
languages and programs. Programming for this course is to be done in
a research language (ATS) and the amount of programming is light overall.

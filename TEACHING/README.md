# Teaching

I primarily teach the following courses at BUCS:

* Introduction to Programming (DS) (CS112)
* Concepts of Programming Languages (CS320)
* Compiler Design and Implementation (CS525)
* Principles of Programming Languages (CS520)

## Spring, 2025

I am scheduled to teach BU CAS CS392 in Spring, 2025.
Note that this class is designed to be a faster-paced version of CS112.
Please read the [slides](./CS392/admin/faster-paced.pdf) for more information.

### Grading Policy

First and foremost, if you are not sure about what is being asked
to do, please seek clarification on the Piazza page.

If you feel that your work is not fairly graded, please raise your
concern to me ASAP. If you don't, then I could not tell.

1. For a programming task, your implementation must compile and pass a
given test in order for you to receive credit.

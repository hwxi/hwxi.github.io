# Teaching

I primarily teach the following courses at BUCS:

* Compiler Design and Implementation (CS525)
* Principles of Programming Languages (CS520)
* Concepts of Programming Languages (CS320)

## Spring, 2021

I am scheduled to teach BU CAS CS520 in Spring, 2021.

### Title

* Principles of Programming Languages

### Overview

This is a course that introduces students to some fundamental
principles and techniques in modern programming language design and
implementation. It focuses on using types to specify and then verify a
variety of program invariants while emphasizing the need for
mathematical formalism in both describing and analyzing programming
languages and programs. Programming for this course is to be done in
a research language (ATS) and the amount of programming is light overall.

### Prerequisites

Familiarity with programming in general:

* CS320 (Concepts of Programming Languages) or Equivalents

### Reference Books
  
1. [Introduction to Programming in ATS](http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/HTMLTOC/book1.html) by Hongwei Xi.
2. [A Crash into Functional Programming via ATS](http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/ATS2FUNCRASH/HTML/HTMLTOC/book1.html) by Hongwei Xi.
3. [Practical Foundations for Programming Languages](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/plbook/book.pdf) by Robert Harper.

### Programming Languages

* [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org) (this
  [mode](http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/ATS-Postiats/utils/emacs/ats2-mode.el)
  may be helpful if you use emacs to edit ATS source code)

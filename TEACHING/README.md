# Teaching

I primarily teach the following courses at BUCS:

* Compiler Design and Implementation (CS525)
* Concepts of Programming Languages (CS320)
* Principles of Programming Languages (CS520)

## Summer I, 2024

I am scheduled to teach BU CAS CS320 in Summer I, 2024.

### Title

* Concepts of Programming Languages

### Overview

Concepts of Programming Languages (CPL) is a course that introduces
students to some fundamental concepts in programming language design and
implementation. The primary goal is to allow students who complete this
subject to have a good feel for the elements of style and aesthetics of
programming and a good command of the major techniques for controlling
complexity in programming.

SML is a functional programming language that makes pervasive use of
types in capturing programming invariants. We will be starting with
SML and then making a gradual transition from SML to Python so as to
demonstrate concretely that the concepts learned in the context of SML
can be readily applied in the context of Python, one of the most
popular language in the world.

Ultimately, we would like to make a convincing argument that programming
can be a great deal of fun if you do it the right way!

### Grading Policy

First and foremost, if you are not sure about what is being asked
to do, please seek clarification on the Piazza page.

If you feel that your work is not fairly graded, please raise your
concern to me ASAP. If you don't, then I could not tell.

1. For a programming task, your implementation must compile and pass a
given test in order for you to receive *any* credit.

* CS111 & CS112 (Introduction to Programming in Python and Java)

### Textbooks

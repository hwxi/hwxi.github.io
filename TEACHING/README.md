# Teaching

I primarily teach the following courses at BUCS:

* Introduction to Programming II (CS112)
* Concepts of Programming Languages (CS320)
* Compiler Design and Implementation (CS525)
* Principles of Programming Languages (CS520)

## Spring, 2026

I am scheduled to teach BU CAS CS392X1 in Spring, 2026.  Note that
this class is designed to be a faster-paced version of CS112.  Please
read the [slides](./CS392/2026Sprn/admin/faster-paced.pdf) for more
information.

### Title

* Introduction to Programming II (Data Structures)

### Overview

This course starts by quickly revisiting and then building upon basic
programming concepts in Java. Then, the main focus of the course is on
the design, analysis and implementation of fundamental data structures
used throughout computer science. These include linked lists, stacks,
queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, as well as specialized methods for
searching and sorting. All of our implementations will be in the the
object-oriented programming language Java. The emphasis in teaching
this course centers around the following:

* Developing elegant and efficient code from an abstract specification;

* Literate programming (writing programs that can be read by humans as well
as machines);

* Developing a toolbox of advanced data structures for use in your future
programming tasks, and an awareness of various design patterns that recur
frequently in advanced programming;

* Critical thinking about programs and the programming process, which
involves:
  * Thinking about the best way to plan out the design using object-oriented
    design and appropriate features of Java;
  * Methodical and efficient development of the implementation using step-wise
    refinement and incremental testing and debugging (using appropriate
    debugging tools);
  * Being able to convince yourself of the correctness of the implementation by
    mathematical reasoning;
  * Analyzing the running time (efficiency) of programs by inspection and
    mathematical reasoning; and
  * Evaluating the efficiency and correctness of programs empirically, by using
    various tools in properly designed experiments.

### Grading Policy

First and foremost, if you are not sure about what is being asked
to do, please seek clarification on the Piazza page.

If you feel that your work is not fairly graded, please raise your
concern to me ASAP. If you don't, then I could not tell. In general,
grading tends to be interactive in the sense that you may receive
feedback on your code and then be allowed to fix bugs if there are
any.

### Prerequisites

Some basic familiarity with programming in general:

* CS111 (Introduction to Programming in Python)
* Some basic knowledge of Java is expected of you

### Textbooks

Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, Princeton University.

### Programming Languages

* Java
